# CSV_Data_Read
This is my first repository for Data Extraction and Data Visualisation using Python.
The attached file is of type .csv file which is the dataset for this task. We have to read the keywords column and assign it to a Python data structure and then separate words using the ";" separator. 
Count the frequency of each word using the WordCloud which takes input as a Python dictionary.
